# Project Background

As part of my MS Thesis, I will need to count deer across several thousand camera trap photos. To speed this up, someone developed an AI that will supposedly count deer in the photos for us. However, before we adopt the AI, I want to compare the AI's counts to our handmade counts, and see if there are any site-level or seasonal differences in its counting ability. This book documents my evaluation of the AI's effectiveness.
